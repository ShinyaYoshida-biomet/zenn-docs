# Introduction
As of spring 2024, the generative AI boom is sweeping the world. Recently, there has been significant progress in developing tools that automate the work of engineers.

- [GPT Engineer](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer) launched last spring
- Microsoft's highly anticipated [AutoDev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8Fow7mMrhQ)
- The rumored [Autonomous AI (Devin)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjHtjT7GO1c) with a waiting list

Each time these AI tools emerge, the debate arises: **Will engineers become unnecessary with the use of generative AI?**

üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I firmly say No to this debate.
üñ• My years of experience in web application development and intuition tell me so.
However, I understand that some people might think, "You're just saying that because you're an engineer."

Honestly, I didn't have a clear rebuttal to such comments.
As a result, it was challenging to assert that engineers are still needed.

Perhaps there are other engineers or aspiring engineers who feel the same way and are hesitant to say No confidently.

This article is written with passion and enthusiasm for those engineers and aspiring engineers.
To make the argument more relatable and convincing, I will divide the discussion into three timelines:

1. The immediate future: tomorrow, next week, next month.
2. Several years to a decade later: when AI-generated code quality has improved.
3. The future when singularity has arrived.

I will avoid using technical jargon as much as possible to make it easy to understand for people from various backgrounds.
üôè I hope this article helps existing engineers and aspiring engineers continue to build their confidence.

# Chapter 1: The Immediate Future - Tomorrow, Next Week, Next Month
First, let's consider the immediate future: tomorrow, next week, next month.
What would happen if engineers suddenly disappeared in the near future?

## 1.1 AI-Generated Code is Not Perfect Yet

How is the code generated by AI currently?
It is far from perfect and doesn't always produce code that works right away.
Engineers often need to fix the code generated by AI.

Engineers üßë‚Äçüíª are still needed to create systems.

## 1.2 Existing Products Need Maintenance

But let's assume that AI-generated code miraculously works perfectly.
Would the organization or team with that system no longer need engineers?

üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The answer is No.
Even in that case, issues arise when there are specification changes or framework updates.
Such updates can cause bugs or performance degradation.

In such situations, engineers are the ones who can be trusted with maintenance.
"Can't we just give the new specifications or framework information to the generative AI and have it write new code?"
some might think.

But who is best suited to quickly and accurately convey such update information to AI?
Engineers with specialized knowledge and practical experience are more suitable than non-engineers with zero knowledge.

Therefore, people who maintain existing products, üßë‚Äçüíª engineers, will continue to be needed.

## 1.3 Engineers are Needed for AI Evolution

Moreover, how can we ensure that AI-generated code is bug-free and can handle specification changes?
That's right. We need to develop even more advanced AI.

So, who will develop such AI?
Engineers (specifically, AI engineers, a type of engineer).

In other words, the evolution of AI depends on the efforts of engineers.

As the demand for further AI development grows, üßë‚Äçüíª engineers who develop AI will not become unnecessary.

## 1.4 Summary
To summarize Chapter 1:
What would happen if engineers suddenly disappeared and only generative AI remained?
Humanity would face significant problems for the following reasons:

1. **AI-generated code is not perfect, so new systems cannot be created.**
2. **There would be no one to accurately and quickly maintain existing products.**
3. **There would be no one to develop further AI to solve the above two issues.**

# Chapter 2: Several Years to a Decade Later - When AI-Generated Code Quality Has Improved

In Chapter 1, we discussed the hypothetical scenario of engineers suddenly disappearing.
Now, let's consider the future several years to a decade later when generative AI has advanced.

In this future, AI-generated code is perfect.
The code generated by AI can be immediately integrated into products.
Additionally, it can automatically handle specification changes and framework updates.

In such a future, AI engineers might no longer be needed as AI development is no longer necessary.
It seems that the issues raised in Chapter 1 have been mostly resolved.
In this scenario, using AI to create products has become the norm.

## 2.1 AI-Generated Code Becomes Homogeneous
ü§î However, in such a future, a new problem arises.
AI-generated code tends to be homogeneous.

Code generated from simple prompts tends to be similar ([*1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/erosion-human-creativity-cautionary-tale-generative-ai-kapil-saxena#:~:text=2.%20The%20Homogenization%20Hazard%3A)).
As a result, many products with similar functionality and performance levels are created.
This makes it difficult to differentiate products and maintain competitive advantage.

Capitalism always seeks competitive advantage,
so companies will try to differentiate their products to maintain their competitive edge.

## 2.2 Methods to Differentiate from AI-Generated Code
What does differentiation specifically look like?
Let's imagine the differentiation elements that engineers have been responsible for.
For example, speeding up search queries or improving image recognition accuracy.

Given that other products are created with AI-generated code,
companies will look for ways to achieve functionality and performance beyond AI-generated code.

There are two main ways to achieve this:

1. **Analyze and improve existing AI-generated code.**
2. **Create AI that surpasses existing AI.**

‚úÖ In case 1, engineers are needed to analyze existing code.
Additionally, engineers are needed to create algorithms for improvement.
‚úÖ In case 2, engineers are needed to create AI.

## 2.3 Engineers' Skills Improve with Technological Advancements
However, more specialized knowledge and experience will be required than in Chapter 1.
Therefore, some might think,
ü§î "Won't many engineers become unnecessary in the future described in Chapter 2?"

üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I firmly say No to this as well.

Imagine the era when only HTML and CSS existed.
In that era, having knowledge of HTML and CSS was enough to create websites.
However, it took a considerable amount of time to create a single page.

As time passed, new technologies like JavaScript and React.js emerged.
Creating more advanced websites required more knowledge and experience.
However, the time required to create a single page was significantly reduced.

As a result, the quality of engineers improved compared to the era when only HTML and CSS existed.
Not only did the number of websites an engineer could create increase, but the range of projects they could handle throughout their career also expanded.
Modern engineers are more efficient and experienced than their counterparts from the past.

‚úÖ In other words, engineers' skills improve with technological advancements.

Similarly, AI advancements will increase engineers' efficiency and speed of gaining experience.
Therefore, the number of engineers who reach the level of analyzing and improving AI-generated code will be much larger than currently expected.

This concludes the rebuttal to the question, "Won't many engineers become unnecessary in the future described in Chapter 2?"

## 2.4 Summary
In a future where AI generates perfect code:

‚úÖ Engineers are still needed to maintain competitive advantage.
‚úÖ Engineers' skills improve with technological advancements, so many engineers will not become unnecessary due to lack of skills.

# Chapter 3: The Future When Singularity Has Arrived

There is one loophole in the discussion of Chapter 2.
In Chapter 2, we mentioned that engineers are needed to create AI that surpasses existing AI.
But what if AI that improves AI-generated code emerges?

Such a future is referred to as the singularity ([*2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20most%20popular%20version%20of%20the%20singularity%20hypothesis%2C%20I.%20J.%20Good%27s%20intelligence%20explosion%20model%2C%20an%20upgradable%20intelligent%20agent%20will%20eventually%20enter%20a%20%22runaway%20reaction%22%20of%20self%2Dimprovement%20cycles%2C%20each%20new%20and%20more%20intelligent%20generation%20appearing%20more%20and%20more%20rapidly%2C)).

In a future where singularity has been reached, a common concern is the possibility of AI decisions and actions harming humans.
Think of a future like the movie Terminator.
In Terminator, AI seeks the optimal future for Earth and tries to eliminate humans.

How can we prevent AI from harming humans in advance?

To do so, we need people who understand the current state of algorithms and control the direction of AI evolution.
People with such advanced IT expertise can be called "engineers."

**In other words, even in a future where singularity has arrived, engineers are needed to ensure coexistence between AI and humanity.**

# Conclusion

In conclusion, we have debunked the myth that engineers will become unnecessary in the age of generative AI by dividing the discussion into timelines.
We have reached the conclusion that while the role of engineers may change as AI evolves, engineers will not become unnecessary.

**To be prepared for such necessary roles in the future,**
**it is essential to continue building our skills daily.**

No matter what future awaits, let's continue to work hard and build our confidence as engineers!
